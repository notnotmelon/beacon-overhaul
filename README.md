### Overhauls the beacon system in both vanilla and modded
Beacons have 3x range and 2x module slots, but will overload machines if you use more than one.
Also adds productivity beacons that give a 4% productivity bonus and do not overload machines.
Productivity beacons can be disabled in the mod settings.

### Balancing
Vanilla beacons are boring. They force your base into tight rows, and have no variety since speed is the only useful module.
This mod attempts to fix that.

The beacon's extra range and overload mechanic means that your base will use far fewer beacons in total
The productivity beacons will add more variety to beacons, and will make up for the lack of speed beacons
